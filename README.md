# The_AdaptiFork
üç¥ The AdaptiFork: A Modular Accessibility Hub Overview The AdaptiFork is a modern, modular, and contributor-friendly browser extension designed to instantly enhance web accessibility for every user. Unlike monolithic tools, AdaptiFork's core strength lies in its defined, extensible architecture. Features (like Text Scaling, High Contrast, and Spacing) are defined as self-contained JSON objects, making it incredibly simple for contributors to "fork" or add new accessibility capabilities without touching core UI or storage logic.  Key Features Modular Feature Definitions: New features are added by defining their properties (id, icon, grid_space, code function) in a centralized list. This decouples feature UI from implementation logic.  Instant Toolbar Access: The user interface is presented as a clean, responsive toolbar popup (built with Tailwind CSS), allowing for immediate, site-wide adjustments.  Drag-and-Drop Customization: Users can personalize their control panel using a drag-and-drop "Edit Tiles" modal to activate, deactivate, and reorder features based on their personal needs.  Decoupled Architecture: The UI logic (popup.js) handles user interaction and storage, while the application logic (content.js) runs only on the webpage to apply the saved effects via CSS variables and filters, ensuring speed and reliability.  Why "The AdaptiFork"? The name signifies the project's dual mission: Adaptability for users (making the web conform to their needs) and Forkability for developers (providing a clear, separated codebase for easy contributions and future feature expansion).
