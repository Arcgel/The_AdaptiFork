üç¥ The AdaptiFork: A Modular Accessibility Hub
üí° Project Overview
The AdaptiFork is a highly modular and contributor-friendly browser extension that acts as a customizable accessibility hub for the web.

Unlike monolithic tools, AdaptiFork's core strength lies in its defined, extensible architecture. Features (like Text Scaling, High Contrast, and Spacing) are defined as self-contained objects, making it incredibly simple for users to manage their tools and for contributors to "fork" or add new accessibility capabilities without touching core UI or storage logic.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation (Chrome / Edge)
Since The AdaptiFork is designed for easy contribution, you load it directly into your browser using Developer Mode.

Clone or Download: Get the project files and place the entire folder on your local machine.

Open Extensions: Open your browser and navigate to the extension management page:

Chrome: Type chrome://extensions in the address bar.

Edge: Type edge://extensions in the address bar.

Enable Developer Mode: Toggle the Developer mode switch, typically found in the top right corner.

Load Unpacked: Click the Load unpacked button.

Select Folder: Navigate to and select the root directory of the project (the folder containing manifest.json, popup.html, etc.).

The extension icon (the "mushroom" or gear) will now appear in your browser's toolbar.

üöÄ How to Use
Open Any Webpage: Navigate to a site you want to test or view.

Access the Panel: Click the AdaptiFork icon in your browser toolbar.

Apply Features: Click any tile (like Text Size or Brightness) to instantly apply the accessibility adjustment to the webpage.

Customize: Click the Edit Tiles button to open the customization modal, where you can activate, deactivate, and reorder features for your personal hub.
