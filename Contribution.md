### Current Architecture

- **popup.html** - UI structure with 8 organized categories
- **popup.css** - Professional dark theme styling
- **popup.js** - UI control logic and event handlers
- **content.js** - Page manipulation and CSS injection
- **background.js** - Service worker for extension lifecycle

### Ways to Contribute

2. **Improve UI/UX** - Enhance the interface design and user experience
3. **Fix Bugs** - Report and fix any issues you find
4. **Improve Documentation** - Help make the docs clearer and more comprehensive
5. **Add Tests** - Create testing scripts for features

### Adding a New Tool

To add a new tool to the extension:

1. **Choose a Category**: Decide which category your tool belongs to (Visual Effects, Typography, Layout, etc.)

2. **Update popup.html**: Add your tool's HTML structure in the appropriate category section following the existing pattern:
```html
<div class="tool-card">
    <div class="tool-header">
        <span class="tool-icon">üé®</span>
        <h3 class="tool-name">Your Tool Name</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="tool-control">
        <!-- Add toggle, slider, dropdown, or button -->
    </div>
</div>
```

3. **Update popup.js**: Add event listeners and control logic for your tool

4. **Update content.js**: Implement the actual page modification logic using CSS injection

5. **Test Thoroughly**: Test your tool on multiple websites to ensure compatibility

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use **camelCase** for JavaScript variables and functions
- Use **kebab-case** for HTML IDs and CSS classes
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Follow the existing code structure and patterns
- Ensure all features work in real-time
- Save settings to `chrome.storage.local` for persistence

### üí° Best Practices

- **CSS Injection**: Use CSS filters and transforms for visual effects
- **Performance**: Keep modifications lightweight and efficient
- **Compatibility**: Test on various websites (news, social media, documentation sites)
- **Accessibility**: Ensure your tools don't break website accessibility
- **User Experience**: Provide clear labels and intuitive controls
- **Error Handling**: Handle edge cases gracefully
